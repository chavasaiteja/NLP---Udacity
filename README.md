# Natural Language Processing

This repository contains work that I did as part of Natural Language Processing Nano degree program on Udacity. 


## Projects implemented are as follows:

### 1. Part's of Speech Tagger.

Built a Part's of Speech Tagger using Hidden Markov Models.

### 2. Machine Translation.

Machine Translation using Recurrent Neural Networks.

### 3. Generating TV Scripts using RNN.

VUI Speech Recognizer -  Built an End to End Automatic Speech Recognizer using Recurrent Neural Networks and Convolutional Neural Networks.
